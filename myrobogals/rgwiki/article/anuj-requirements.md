# Robogals Requirements Document (Anuj)
## Background
Robogals is an international student-run organisation that aims to inspire, engage and empower young women to consider studying engineering and related fields. Its primary activity is interactive, engineering based workshops for students aged between in primary and high schools. Robogals has chapters at 31 universities across Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan. These chapters fall into three regions - Robogals Asia Pacific, Robogals EMEA (Europe, Middle East, & Africa), and Robogals North America. They are all overseen by the Robogals Global Team.

Robogals was founded as a student club at the University of Melbourne in July 2008. Following its initial successes in Melbourne, the organisation was expanded throughout Australia in 2009 by inviting female engineering students from four more universities around Australia to a three-day boot camp at the University of Melbourne where they learned how to run a Robogals chapter back at their home university.

myRobogals was built in 2010 as a way of managing our rapidly growing organisation. Today, it is our global intranet and record-keeping tool, designed to simplify many of Robogals' day-to-day tasks including organising school visits, maintaining a member database, communicating with members, storing records reliably and easily collecting statistics on a global scale.

Since its initial inception, myRobogals has not been upgraded since. There has been a discontinued project for rebuilding the platform from scratch in the past but moving forward, we have decided to piggy back off the old platform and give it a new look and feel. The reason for this was because much of the functionality was already there and bug-free. We would have to invest a lot of resources to rebuilding an already existing, functioning platform.

## Vision
Given a timeframe of 6 months from 1st April, we plan to revamp myRobogals into a modern web platform that all Robogals volunteers will see benefit in using.

## Outline
There are 2 bodies of work involved in this project. 

The first will address our biggest problem: How do we best bring value to the users and how to attract more volunteers to use the platform. It is quite an open-ended question and can be approached in a few ways. This could be done through researching similar platforms and what they offer, a series of user surveys or understanding the system well enough to know what to change. The result of this stage will give you a good understanding of what our users want and a basis of solving the next task.

_In regards with the user surveys, I can put you in contact with a lot of the executive teams globally. The executive team can provide a good insight into why and how they are currently using the platform. They are also a good channel to put you in contact with their volunteer base. Give me a number of chapters/execs/volunteers you would like to survey and I'll put you in contact with the appropriate people._

The next body of work will be creating a new sitemap and wireframes of myRobogals which will consider the feedback received from the user surveys performed earlier. The new website will need to be intuitive to use and reflect the modern-day web platforms that are available. For example, the user's profile page can be like Linkedin's profile pages, which will display all the user's achievements and volunteer hours, which will allow the user to show off the potential employers their involvement with our organisation. A wireframe will be created for this scenario. The entire myRobogals will need to go through a similar process with the sitemap showing how the whole site will be linked together.

## Deliverables
There are 2 deliverables for this project.

**1. Research phase**

A 2-page document which summaries the research and user surveys which will include (but not limited to):
- Summary of what the volunteers of the organisation think about the platform.
- What do our users mostly want, i.e. bring them the most value so they will continue using the platform or **begin** using the platform.
- Plan of action moving forward to the design phase of the website, what needs to be taken into consideration?

**2. Design phase**

The wireframes and sitemap of the new myRobogals.
- **NOTE:** This isn't a designing exercise, it's simply laying out how the new website will **feel**. Another body of work will go into designing the website to align with our design policies.
- It should be presented in a format you feel is best to demonstrate the new layout. It should be portable and can be opened on any PC.
- There will be a review meeting to refine your idea followed by a final presentation.

## Timeline
The timeline can be fleshed out on our initial meeting. The time length for this project will be 2 months from the date of our initial meeting. In that time, it can loosely translate to the following:

**Deliverable 1 (3 weeks)**
1. Day going over myRobogals and the platform. Initial brainstorming and idealization session.
2. Research on similar platforms and why users find their platforms useful.
3. Create surveys.
4. Send out surveys to chapter executives and/or volunteers. I'd suggest you get in contact with their most active volunteers directly, since chapter executives tends to not follow up on their volunteers with this sort of stuff.
5. Collate report based on research and surveys. (Meeting Required - Location TBD)

**Deliverable 2 (5 weeks)**
1. Start going through myRobogals site page by page and map out the current sitemap and think of improvements.
2. Design a new sitemap and wireframes of various important pages for review. (Week 3 - Location TBD)
3. Finish off the sitemap and wireframes based on feedback.
